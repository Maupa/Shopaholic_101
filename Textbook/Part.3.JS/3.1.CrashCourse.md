# JavaScript crash course.

This part will be rather short. We will be covering JavaScript history and the basics of writing code in it.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dialect of EcmaScript. It is a dynamic prototype scripting language that is generally used for browser scripting, but also can be used server side(NodeJS, io.js). Most famous JavaScript engines are V8(Google), SpiderMonkey(Mozilla/Firefox) and Rhino(Mozilla).

## History

**Brendan Eich**

JavaScript was developed in 1995 by Brendon Eich while he was working in Netscape(now Mozilla Foundation). Original name was LiveScript, but since in those days word `Java` were really popular, so he decided to call it JavaScript. In 1997 Ecma International(till 1994 European Computer Manufacturers Association - **ECMA**) with support from Netscape delivered official standardized specification of JavaScript, that called ECMAScript.

## The code

Note: I will be shortening name JavaScript to JS.

### Variables and atoms

JS is a dynamic language or to be correct, it is dynamically typed. That means that you do not need define type of variable when you creating it. Think about variable like a cup. You don't need to define cup for coffee, for tea, for rice, you just simply pour tea into the cup and drink it. Same concept applies here.

In JS there three main `atom` types. 

 - String - we can simply call it text. Example: 'milk', 'I love you!', '42' etc.
 - Integer - A whole number. Example: 1, 2, 42, -275 etc.
 - Float - Like integer, but can hold decimal numbers. Example: 3.14159265359...
 - Boolean - True/False

They are called `atoms because they are the most basic types in the language.
In JS you must initialize variable. To do this you simply place `var` before varible.

```js
var x = 'hello'; //Defining variable x with string value 'hello'

x 	= 	'alice'; //Assigning string 'alice'

x 	= 	42; 	//Assigning integer

x 	= 	3.14; 	//Assigning float 

x 	= 	true;	//Assigning boolean

```

### Arrays
An Array is an indexed collection of elements. To access element you need to know the index of it. Usually in most of the programming languages you define it in square brackets `[] === Array`. Think about `array` like its a street. Each house has its number(index).

Note: In programming you start to count from `0`, not `1`. So first element will always be `0`.

```js
// element   0    1     2    3
var array = [1, 'two', 3.14, []];

array[0] === 1; //Will return element 0 which is equal to 1

array[1] === 'two'; 

array[2] === 3.14;

array[3] === []; //Will return an empty array
```

To add item to array you `push` it:

```js

var array = [];

array.push('hello');
array.push('world!');

array === ['hello', 'world!'];
```

To find length of the array you simply 'length' it:

```js

var array = ['1', 2, 3.14];

array.length === 3;
```

To change the value of the item in the array you simply assign a value to it. Like with variables:

```js
var words = ['Hello','world','!'];
words[1] = 	'Alice'; //Assigning value of string 'Alice' to element 1 in array of words.

words === 	['Hello','Alice','!'];
```

To remove item from the array you need to splice it:

`Array.splice(index, how many to remove starting at the index)`

```js
var array = ['1', 2, 3.14]
//            remove 1
array.splice(0, 1);
//   start index

array === [2, 3.14];
```

### Objects

Objects are key-value data structures. You give it a key, it gives you the value. Real world example could be your self: eye_colour(key) - green(value), hair_colour - blond, height - 192cm... etc. 

Accessing objects done the same way as array, except instead of index you give it a key. Accessing can be done three ways:

 - Array style - `object['key'] === 'value'` - If key does not exist, will return `undefined`
 - Static style(Hard-coded method) - `object.key === 'value'` - If key does not exist, will return error. Use this style only if you are sure that key exists.

```js
var me = {
	eye_colour:		'green',
	hair_colour:	'blond',
	height:			192
}

me['eye_colour']	=== 	'green';

object.hair_colour	=== 	'blond';

object['height']	=== 	192;

```

Creating and modifying key done same way as array, except, again, instead of index, you use key.

```js
var car = {};

car['colour'] = 'red';

car.weight = 687;
```

### Logic statements

#### Equal sign

In most of the programming languages `single` equal sign means `assigning`: `var x = 42;`, and `double` are for comparing `x == 42`. In JS you need to use `triple` equal for comparing. This is due to the fact that in JS `double` equal is not `explicit`. By `explicit` I mean allowing you to compare only the same `types`. `integer` to `integer`, `string` to `string`, etc. Because `==` is not `explicit` you can do `naughty` comparing like `table == chair`, `Space_shuttle == pancake`, `0 == []` and so on. So you should always  use `===`. Example:

```js
var x = 0;

//Never do this
x == []; //True 
x == '0'; //True

//Do this instead.
x === []; //False - because comparing integer to an array
x === '0';//False - because comparing integer to a string

```

Negative statement like `x is not y` use `!`,exclamation mark, instead of first equal: `x !== y`. The `!` can be used to `negate` the outcome. For example if you have `var x = false` then you can simply do negative comparing with `!`: `if(!x) -> if not x -> not false == true -> true`
```js
var negative = false;
if(!negative){
	console.log('I am not negative! *(')
}
```

#### if

In JS like in any programming language there is an `if` statement. There two ways of doing it:
 - Classical way 
```
if(statement){
	/*Do if*/
}else if(statement){
	/*Do else if*/
}else{
	/*Do else*/
}
```

Example:
```js
var x = 42;
if(x === 42){
	console.log('X is 42');
}else if(x < 42){
	console.log('X is smaller then 42');
}else{
	console.log('X is bigger then 42');
}
```

 - Short way - some situations require one short statement, but you don't really want to write a big `if` construction. For that reason we have `?` 

`var x = statement ? possitive : negative`

```js
var x = 42;
var y = x == 42 ? 'X is 42' : 'X is NOT 42' 
y === 'X is 42'

var x = 32;
var y = x == 42 ? 'X is 42' : 'X is NOT 42' 
y === 'X is NOT 42'

```


### Functions

Functions are like a toaster. You put piece of bread into the toaster, it toasts it, and gives you toast. It is the same for functions. You give a function information, it process it, and returns you the value. 

In JS we initialize a function with the magic word `function`. And we can do it two ways:

 - Classical way - `function hello(){ return 'world'; }`
 - OO(Object Orientated way) - `var hello = function(){ return 'world';}`

The way you call functions is by simply adding a pair of round brackets on the end of the name.

```js
var hello = function(){ 
	return 'world';
}
hello() === 'world';
```

Functions can take arguments(parameters): 

```js
var SayHelloTo = function(name){
	return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
}
```

So now we have `function` with `1` argument called `name`. We can access the argument the same way as a variable.

Now we can run the function with an argument.

```js
SayHelloTo('Martin') === 'Hello Martin!';
```

Note: All arguments **MUST** be entered, and they **MUST** be entered in the same sequence as defined in the function. Example:

```js
var me = function(name, height){
	return 'My name is ' + name + '. My height is ' + height + 'cm.';
}

me(192, 'Yuriy') === 'My name is 192. My height is Yuriycm.'; //Not good!

me('Yuriy', 192) === 'My name is Yuriy. My height is 192cm.'; //Thats right!
```

It this course we will be mainly using the Object Orientated way. I will explain why later.

### For loop

Looping is really important ability in all programming languages. In JS you can loop through the list two ways:

 - Classical(i++) way - The way to do this, is to use incremental index. Concept is: You know the length of the array, therefor you can have variable that will be incremental and less then size of the array. Example:
```js
var fruits = ['apple', 'peach', 'plum', 'banana'];
for(var i=0; i < fruits.length; i++){
	console.log(fruits[i])
}
```

 - ES6 way - this example speak for it self:
```js
var fruits = ['apple', 'peach', 'plum', 'banana'];
for (item of fruits) {
	console.log(item);
}
```

### Code style

Last couple things you need know before we start to practice is a code styling. In any programming language good code style is crucial to write good code, elegant code with less mistakes.

 - **SEMICOLON EVERYTHING!** - Semicolons are like insurance. Most of the time it is just a waste of space, but it will ensure that your code will work the same way as you wrote it.

 - **Spacing/Tabbing** - it is way easier to understand code, when it is beautifully spaced:
```js
var hello = function(name){return 'Hello ' + name + '!';}

//VS

var hello = function(name){
	return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
}
```

 - **Quotes** - there are constant arguments about what is better to use: single quotes(') or Double quote("). It is up to you to decide which quotes to use, but if you do, use one type only. Do not mix them up, or your code will become hard to understand.
```js
var bad = function(name){
	return 'Hello ' + name + "!";
}

var good = function(name){
	return 'Hello ' + name + '!';
}
//OR
var good = function(name){
	return "Hello " + name + "!";
}
```


 - **Comment like you on Youtube** - comment code. Explain what it does.
```js
code here... //Single line comment But not here...

code here.. /*Enclosed single line comment*/ ...and here 

/* 
* Multiple
* line
* comment
*/
```

```js
/*
* Written by Yuriy
*/
var sayHelloTo = function(name){ //Says hello to {name}
	return "Hello " + /* I am inside the code*/ name + "!" ;
}
```

 - **Adequate variable name** - variable name must describe what is inside:

```js
//BAD - never do this
var variable1 = 42;
var variable2 = 'hello';
var variable3 = 'world';

//GOOD
var shopping_list = ['butter', 'bread', 'whittakers'];
var name = 'Bob';
var money = 29;

//..etc
```

### Trying it out

Lets create dog. Dog has properties. Object has properties. Therefor we going to use object.

```js
var Dog = {};
```

The dog, can bark. So lets write a function for this:

```js
var Dog = {};
var bark = function(){
	alert('Woof!'); //Alert brings up modal windows with the message. alert('message')
}
bark();
```

We already learned that `function` can be assigned to variable. Based on that fact we an assign function to object parameter.

```js
var Dog = {
	bark: function(){
		alert('Woof!'); //Alert brings up modal windows with the message. alert('message')
	}
}
Dog.bark()
```

Now the `bark` function is a `method` of the `Dog` object. The difference between `method` and a `function` is that `method` is a part of something. If the function is on its own like:

```js
var bark = function(){
	alert('Woof!');
}
```

then it is a `function`. If it is a part of something like `Dog`:

```js
var Dog = {
	bark: function(){
		alert('Woof!'); //Alert brings up modal windows with the message. alert('message')
	}
}
```

then function `bark` is a `method` of the `Dog`. It is minor thing, but we will be using the word `method' quite often in this course, so you will need to remember it.

When we run `Dog.bark()`, it will return `undefined`. This is caused due to the fact that there is no return at the end of the function, and so it will return `undefined`. This normal behavior and you should not worry about it.

Now lets add some other values:

```js
var Dog = {
	pedigree: 'Labrador',
	colour: 'Chocolate',
	hair: 'Short',
	temperament: 'Gentle',
	bark: function(){
		alert('Woof!'); //Alert brings up modal windows with the message. alert('message')
	}
}
```

So now we can `ask` dog for its properties:

```js
Dog.pedigree 	=== 'Labrador';
Dog.colour 		=== 'Chocolate';
Dog.hair 		=== 'Short';
Dog.temperament === 'Gentle';
```

Lets make it more clear by making object `do` in the `Dog` and moving there `bark`.

```js
var Dog = {
	pedigree: 'Labrador',
	colour: 'Chocolate',
	hair: 'Short',
	temperament: 'Gentle',
	do: {
		bark: function(){
			alert('Woof!');
		}
	}
}
```

Now we can simply say: `Dog.do.bark()`.

Now lets teach it to make a mess in our rooms by defining `makeAMess` method, and we gonna parse variable `rooms` that will contain array of rooms that we want it to make a mess in.

```js
var rooms = ['living room', 'garage', 'bedroom', 'kitchen'];
var Dog = {
	pedigree: 'Labrador',
	colour: 'Chocolate',
	hair: 'Short',
	temperament: 'Gentle',
	do: {
		bark: function(){
			alert('Woof!');
		},
		makeAMess: function(rooms){
			for (room of rooms){
				alert('Woof! Made mess in the ' + room + '!');
			}
		}
	}
}
```

No just simply run `Dog.do.makeAMess(rooms)` and enjoy the result.
